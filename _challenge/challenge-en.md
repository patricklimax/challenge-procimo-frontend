PROCIMO CHALLENGE

Hello there, and welcome to Procimo’s Code Challenge: Procimo Tryout (frontend).

Thank you for your interest in being a part of the team and taking the time to show
us your skills!

1. Overview

In this code challenge you’ll be building an App which consults an API to retrieve
geolocated data to expose on a map.

Requirements:
   ● Build a Web App using ReactJS.
   ● Fetch your data from http://api.citybik.es/v2/, an API for Bike Sharing Data.
   ● Show that data on a map, with 3 different layers:
      ○ L1 : Number of networks, per country;
      ○ L2 : Number of stations, per network;
      ○ L3 : Station details.
   ● Allow the user to drilldown, from L1 to L3, by clicking on markers.
   ● Allow the user to go back to the previous layer.

2. Definition of done
Document your project: instructions on how to run, how to test and how to build optimized for production.

You are free to fulfill the requirements however you please - but make sure to follow coding guidelines and best practices.

Make sure that your project can be developed further with quality.

3. Delivery Format
Deliver a compressed file (.zip) with the contents of your project.

We look forward to see what you’ll build!
